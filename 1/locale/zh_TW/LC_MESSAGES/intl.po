"**gettext** [1]_ is an established standard for internationalization and "
"localization.  It naively maps messages in a program to a translated string. "
"Sphinx uses these facilities to translate whole documents."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../intl.rst:28
msgid ""
"Initially project maintainers have to collect all translatable strings (also "
"referred to as *messages*) to make them known to translators.  Sphinx "
"extracts these through invocation of ``sphinx-build -b gettext``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../intl.rst:32
msgid ""
"Every single element in the doctree will end up in a single message which "
"results in lists being equally split into different chunks while large "
"paragraphs will remain as coarsely-grained as they were in the original "
"document.  This grants seamless document updates while still providing a "
"little bit of context for translators in free-text passages.  It is the "
"maintainer's task to split up paragraphs which are too large as there is no "
"sane automated way to do that."

"After Sphinx successfully ran the :class:`~sphinx.builders.gettext."

"Gettext compiles them into a binary format known as **binary catalogs** "
