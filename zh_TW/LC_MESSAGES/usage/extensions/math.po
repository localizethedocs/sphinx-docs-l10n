"Math support for non-HTML builders is integrated to sphinx-core. So mathbase "

"Since mathematical notation isn't natively supported by HTML in any way, "
"Sphinx gives a math support to HTML document with several extensions.  These "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../usage/extensions/math.rst:29
msgid ""
"This extension renders math via LaTeX and dvipng_ or dvisvgm_ into PNG or "
"SVG images. This of course means that the computer where the docs are built "
"must have both programs available."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../usage/extensions/math.rst:33
msgid ""
"There are various configuration values you can set to influence how the "
"images are built:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../usage/extensions/math.rst:38
msgid ""
"The output image format. The default is ``'png'``. It should be either "
"``'png'`` or ``'svg'``. The image is produced by first executing ``latex`` "
"on the TeX mathematical mark-up then (depending on the requested format) "
"either `dvipng`_ or `dvisvgm`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../usage/extensions/math.rst:45
msgid ""
"``dvipng`` and ``dvisvgm`` both have the ability to collect from LaTeX the "
"\"depth\" of the rendered math: an inline image should use this \"depth\" in "
"a ``vertical-align`` style to get correctly aligned with surrounding text."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../usage/extensions/math.rst:49
msgid ""
"This mechanism requires the `LaTeX preview package`_ (available as ``preview-"
"latex-style`` on Ubuntu xenial).  Therefore, the default for this option is "
"``False`` but it is strongly recommended to set it to ``True``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../usage/extensions/math.rst:55
msgid ""
"This option can be used with the ``'svg'`` :confval:`imgmath_image_format`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../usage/extensions/math.rst:59
msgid ""
"Default: ``True``.  If false, do not add the LaTeX code as an \"alt\" "
"attribute for math images."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../usage/extensions/math.rst:64
msgid ""
"The font size (in ``pt``) of the displayed math.  The default value is "
"``12``.  It must be a positive integer."

msgid ""
"Since this setting is not portable from system to system, it is normally not "
"useful to set it in ``conf.py``; rather, giving it on the :program:`sphinx-"
"build` command line via the :option:`-D <sphinx-build -D>` option should be "

"Some fancy LaTeX mark-up (an example was reported which used TikZ to add "
"various decorations to the equation) require multiple runs of the LaTeX "
"executable.  To handle this, set this configuration setting to ``'latexmk'`` "

"Additional LaTeX code to put into the preamble of the LaTeX files used to "
"translate the math snippets.  This is left empty by default.  Use it e.g. to "
"add packages which modify the fonts used for math, such as ``'\\"
"\\usepackage{newtxsf}'`` for sans-serif fonts, or ``'\\"
"\\usepackage{fouriernc}'`` for serif fonts.  Indeed, the default LaTeX math "
"fonts have rather thin glyphs which (in HTML output) often do not match well "

"The command name to invoke ``dvipng``.  The default is ``'dvipng'``; you may "

"to ``'png'``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Additional arguments to give to dvipng, as a list.  The default value is "
"``['-gamma', '1.5', '-D', '110', '-bg', 'Transparent']`` which makes the "
"image a bit darker and larger then it is by default (this compensates "
"somewhat for the thinness of default LaTeX math fonts), and produces PNGs "
