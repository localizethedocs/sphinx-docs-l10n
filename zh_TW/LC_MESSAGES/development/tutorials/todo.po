"The objective of this tutorial is to create a more comprehensive extension "
"than that created in :doc:`helloworld`. Whereas that guide just covered "
"writing a custom :term:`directive`, this guide adds multiple directives, "
"along with custom nodes, additional config values and custom event handlers. "
"To this end, we will cover a ``todo`` extension that adds capabilities to "
"include todo entries in the documentation, and to collect these in a central "
"place. This is similar the ``sphinxext.todo`` extension distributed with "
"Sphinx."

"entry, containing text that gives the location, and a link (reference node "
"containing an italic node) with the backreference. The reference URI is "
