"The :event:`doctree-resolved` event is emitted for each document that is "

"written for this event is a bit more involved. If the ``todo_include_todos`` "
"config value (which we'll describe shortly) is false, all ``todo`` and "
"``todolist`` nodes are removed from the documents. If not, ``todo`` nodes "
"just stay where and how they are.  ``todolist`` nodes are replaced by a list "
"of todo entries, complete with backlinks to the location where they come "

"docutils nodes created on the fly: a paragraph for each entry, containing "
"text that gives the location, and a link (reference node containing an "
"italic node) with the backreference. The reference URI is built by :meth:"
"`sphinx.builders.Builder.get_relative_uri` which creates a suitable URI "
"depending on the used builder, and appending the todo node's (the target's) "
"ID as the anchor name."
