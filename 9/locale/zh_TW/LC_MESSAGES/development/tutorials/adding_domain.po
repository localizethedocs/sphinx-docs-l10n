"There are some interesting things to note about this ``recipe`` domain and "
"domains in general. Firstly, we actually register our directives, roles and "
"indices here, via the ``directives``, ``roles`` and ``indices`` attributes, "
"rather than via calls later on in ``setup``. We can also note that we aren't "
"actually defining a custom role and are instead reusing the :class:`sphinx."
"roles.XRefRole` role and defining the :class:`sphinx.domains.Domain."
"resolve_xref` method. This method takes two arguments, ``typ`` and "
"``target``, which refer to the cross-reference type and its target name. "
"We'll use ``target`` to resolve our destination from our domain's "
"``recipes`` because we currently have only one type of node."

"Moving on, we can see that we've defined ``initial_data``. The values "

"domaindata[domain_name]`` as the initial data of the domain, and domain "
"instances can access it via ``self.data``. We see that we have defined two "
"items in ``initial_data``: ``recipes`` and ``recipe_ingredients``. Each "
"contains a list of all objects defined (i.e. all recipes) and a hash that "
"maps a canonical ingredient name to the list of objects. The way we name "
"objects is common across our extension and is defined in the "
"``get_full_qualified_name`` method. For each object created, the canonical "
"name is ``recipe.<recipename>``, where ``<recipename>`` is the name the "
"documentation writer gives the object (a recipe). This enables the extension "
"to use different object types that share the same name. Having a canonical "
"name and central place for our objects is a huge advantage. Both our indices "
"and our cross-referencing code use this feature."
