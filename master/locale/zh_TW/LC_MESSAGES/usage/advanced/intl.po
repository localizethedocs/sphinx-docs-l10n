"**gettext** [1]_ is an established standard for internationalization and "

"Every single element in the doctree will end up in a single message which "
"results in lists being equally split into different chunks while large "
"paragraphs will remain as coarsely-grained as they were in the original "
"document.  This grants seamless document updates while still providing a "
"little bit of context for translators in free-text passages.  It is the "

"sane automated way to do that."
