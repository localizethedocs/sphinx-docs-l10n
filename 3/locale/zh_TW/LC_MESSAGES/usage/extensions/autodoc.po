"For Sphinx (actually, the Python interpreter that executes Sphinx) to find "

"For this to work, the docstrings must of course be written in correct "
"reStructuredText.  You can then use all of the usual Sphinx markup in the "
"docstrings, and it will end up correctly in the documentation.  Together "
"with hand-written documentation, this technique eases the pain of having to "
"maintain two locations for documentation, while at the same time avoiding "
"auto-generated-looking pure API documentation."
