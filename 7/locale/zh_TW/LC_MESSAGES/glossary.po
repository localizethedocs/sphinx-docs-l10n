msgid ""
"A class (inheriting from :class:`~sphinx.builders.Builder`) that takes "
"parsed documents and performs an action on them.  Normally, builders "
"translate the documents to an output format, but it is also possible to use "
"builders that e.g. check for broken links in the documentation, or build "
"coverage information."

"A reStructuredText markup element that allows marking a block of content "

msgid ""
"Since reStructuredText source files can have different extensions (some "
"people like ``.txt``, some like ``.rst`` -- the extension can be configured "
"with :confval:`source_suffix`) and different OSes have different path "
"separators, Sphinx abstracts them: :dfn:`document names` are always relative "
"to the :term:`source directory`, the extension is stripped, and path "
"separators are converted to slashes.  All values, parameters and such "
"referring to \"documents\" expect such document names."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../glossary.rst:48
msgid ""
"Examples for document names are ``index``, ``library/zipfile``, or "

"in a domain have names like ``domain:name``, e.g. ``py:function``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../glossary.rst:58
msgid ""
"Having domains means that there are no naming problems when one set of "
"documentation wants to refer to e.g. C++ and Python classes.  It also means "
"that extensions that support the documentation of whole new languages are "
"much easier to write."
