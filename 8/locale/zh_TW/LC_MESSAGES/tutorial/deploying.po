"When you are ready to show your documentation project to the world, there "
"are many options available to do so. Since the HTML generated by Sphinx is "
"static, you can decouple the process of building your HTML documentation "
"from hosting such files in the platform of your choice. You will not need a "
"sophisticated server running Python: virtually every web hosting service "
"will suffice."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/deploying.rst:10
msgid ""
"Therefore, the challenge is less how or where to serve the static HTML, but "
"rather how to pick a workflow that automatically updates the deployed "
"documentation every time there is a change in the source files."

msgid ""
"The following sections describe some of the available options to deploy your "
"online documentation, and give some background information. If you want to "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/deploying.rst:25
msgid ""
"`Read the Docs`_ is an online service specialized in hosting technical "
"documentation written in Sphinx, as well as MkDocs. They have a number of "
"extra features, such as versioned documentation, traffic and search "
"analytics, custom domains, user-defined redirects, and more."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/deploying.rst:30
msgid "**GitHub Pages**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/deploying.rst:31
msgid ""
"`GitHub Pages`_ is a simple static web hosting tightly integrated with "
"`GitHub`_: static HTML is served from one of the branches of a project, and "
"usually sources are stored in another branch so that the output can be "
"updated every time the sources change (for example using `GitHub Actions`_). "
"It is free to use and supports custom domains."

#: ../../../tutorial/deploying.rst:37
msgid "**GitLab Pages**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/deploying.rst:38
msgid ""
"`GitLab Pages`_ is a similar concept to GitHub Pages, integrated with "
"`GitLab`_ and usually automated with `GitLab CI`_ instead."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/deploying.rst:41
msgid "**Netlify**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/deploying.rst:42
msgid ""
"`Netlify`_ is a sophisticated hosting for static sites enhanced by client-"
"side web technologies like JavaScript (so-called `\"Jamstack\"`_). They "
"offer support for headless content management systems and serverless "
"computing."

#: ../../../tutorial/deploying.rst:66

"The free offerings of most of the options listed above require your "
"documentation sources to be publicly available. Moreover, these services "
"expect you to use a `Version Control System`_, a technology that tracks the "
"evolution of a collection of files as a series of snapshots (\"commits\"). "
"The practice of writing documentation in plain text files with the same "
"tools as the ones used for software development is commonly known as `\"Docs "
"as Code\"`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/deploying.rst:73
msgid ""
"The most popular Version Control System nowadays is Git_, a free and open "
"source tool that is the backbone of services like GitHub and GitLab. Since "
"both Read the Docs and Netlify have integrations with GitHub and GitLab, and "
"both GitHub and GitLab have an integrated Pages product, the most effective "
"way of automatically build your documentation online is to upload your "
"sources to either of these Git hosting services."
